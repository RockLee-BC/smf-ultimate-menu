# Ultimate Menu
Add custom buttons to the main menu within SMF
## Introduction:
This is a tool for configuring the main menu within SMF, allowing custom buttons to be added at will, complete with children and grandchildren menus (so, a main menu item, a dropdown and a follow-on dropdown)

## Known issues:
-  Grandchild butons cannot be added using 'before'  or 'after'; not sure how to fix this

###Future plans:
-  Complete rewrite using objects
-  Follow PSR-2 and PSR-4
-  Use generators (PHP 5.5+)
-  Use closures (PHP 5.3+)
-  Use late statiic bindigs (PHP 5.3+)
-  any suggestion that would come up in the topic
